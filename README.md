# MediTrack Project

### Introduction
___

The speed of modern life drags us along, more and more with it. Every day we neglect important parts of our lives, just trying to keep up with these rhythms. Among all the things we leave aside is also our health, which is very important. This phenomenon is particularly common, especially in older people. Recognising all of the above, the MediTrack app comes to fill this gap by offering its users an easier way to manage the various medications they need to take. It aims to organize a database where the user records all the information about the medicines he needs to take and at the same time provides easy access to this database in order to inform the user about his records.
